# From histograms
print("1. Most passengers are young (20â€“40 years). Fare is heavily right-skewed â€” few passengers paid high fares.")

# From boxplot
print("2. Passengers in 1st class are older on average than those in 2nd or 3rd class. More outliers exist in 3rd class.")

# From correlation matrix
print("3. 'Pclass' has a moderate negative correlation with 'Survived' (-0.34), meaning survival rate drops with lower class.")
print("4. 'Fare' has a positive correlation with 'Survived' (0.26), suggesting that passengers who paid more had better chances of survival.")

# From pairplot
print("5. Survival is clearly higher in Class 1 with higher fares. Very few survived in Class 3 with low fare.")
print("6. No strong linear correlation between 'Age' and 'Survived', but visually young children show a slight survival edge.")

# From missing values
print("7. 'Age' and 'Cabin' have many missing values. Cabin may need to be dropped or transformed (e.g., use Deck letter).")

# From SibSp/Parch
print("8. Most passengers were alone (SibSp=0, Parch=0), with small family groups being more common than large ones.")

# Final insight
print("9. Categorical features like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' will also play a major role in modeling, especially 'Sex'.")
